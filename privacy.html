  <h1>Privacy Policy for PHOENIX GAMING Discord Bot</h1>
  <p>Last updated: <strong>November 2025</strong></p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    PHOENIX GAMING Bot may collect limited user data such as Discord user IDs,
    server IDs, and message content only when required for core features like moderation,
    logging, or user-specific settings. No personal information outside of Discord is collected.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>
    Collected data is used solely to provide bot functionality — such as command responses,
    moderation logs, and server configuration. We never sell, rent, or share this data with third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage & Security</h2>
  <p>
    All stored data is securely kept in protected environments accessible only to verified
    bot developers. We follow best practices to ensure data safety and integrity.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Removal</h2>
  <p>
    Server administrators may request deletion of all server data by removing the bot from their server
    or by contacting the developer through Discord support channels.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The bot may interact with Discord APIs and other third-party libraries. These are subject
    to their own respective privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Contact Information</h2>
  <p>
    For any questions or concerns regarding this policy, please contact:
    <br><strong>Discord:</strong> <code>@pxvenom69</code>  
    <br><strong>Email:</strong> <code>support.phoenixbot@gmail.com</code>
